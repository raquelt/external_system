External System Functionality Plugins
=====================================
Problem?
If a ticket in UDo is created by an external system, UDo may need to notify the external system of certain events upon the ticket. 
UDo should also record the notification result in the ticket history.
The integration with each external system may imply different degree of notification events, i.e., some external systems will need more notifications than others. 
The solution should work in a generic way for all possible external systems

#Â Chosen implementation: external_systems_creator_with_decorator.py

"A base class is defined that will be extended for any particular implementation that might be needed for a connectivity with a third party. On this base class all possible events are defined (action_*) and the specific class for connecting with an external system X only defines the needed methods as _action_*.
We use a decorator to check if from the name of the function passed as argument (action_*) the implementing class defines that method (_action_*). If it's the case, it's executed and stored in a historic

# An alternative: external_systems_creator_with_metaclass.py
"A base class is defined that will be extended for any particular implementation that might be needed for a connectivity with a third party. On this base class all possible events are defined (action_*) and the specific class for connecting with an external system X only redefines the needed action_* methods.
We use a metaclass to decorate all methods from base class (and the classes that inherit from them) that start with "action_". The decorator calls the method (action_*) passed as argument.
If the method returns NotImplemented exception, do nothing. Otherwise record if the result of the operation.
